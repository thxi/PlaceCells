nerve lemma
if V is a finite collection of subsets of X with all non-emppty intersections of subcollections of V contractible, then N(V) is homotopic to the union of elements of V
if create simplicial complex -> same homology (and homotopy)

filtered simplicial complex
persistent homologies (ignore new holes???)
